# HOUSING-DYNAMIC-ANALYSIS
In this project I successfully completed a comprehensive analysis of the factors that affect home prices within a 
specific housing market, using a combination of Python, SQL, and Tableau. Leveraging a diverse dataset, which 
had 20000 rows and 15 columns, I uncovered valuable insights into factors influencing home prices and market 
dynamics. One significant finding was the positive correlation between the number of bedrooms and home prices, 
indicating that larger properties tend to command higher values. Additionally, I identified zip code as a crucial 
location factor boasting the highest prices, also highlighted the impact of waterfront views on home prices, with 
properties offering such views consistently commanding higher values, I found out that larger homes are often more 
desirable in the market. I further investigated the influence of the number of floors on home prices and identified a 
preference for two-and-a-half-story homes. I utilized SQL queries to extract valuable information from the dataset. 
This included calculating average prices by grade, identifying top and bottom zip codes by total sales, ranking houses 
by price per square foot within each zip code, assessing year-over-year price changes for different zip codes, 
analyzing bedroom-based price variations, and exploring the impact of condition and waterfront views on home 
prices. I also used Tableau show all findings using various charts and dashboard. Based on the analysis, I 
recommend focusing on homes with 2 to 2.5 floors, which tend to command higher prices. Additionally, closely 
monitor the unusual price fluctuations in early 2015 to understand their underlying factors. Finally, consider investing 
in properties located in zip codes with historically high sales for potential growth.
